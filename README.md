# ZD-NeRF
This is an implementation of a dynamic nerf that adds extra constraints to hopefully improve the performance of dynamic nerfs. This project uses nerfacc for the rendering the nerf and its implementation of DNeRF as a base to work off of.

## nerfacc
This project uses the nerfacc module for rendering the NeRF and example code from the repository which is found here: [https://github.com/KAIR-BAIR/nerfacc](https://github.com/KAIR-BAIR/nerfacc).
